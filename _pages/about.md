### Hello! I´m Jorge 👋🏼

🧑🏻‍💻I am a first year PhD student at Sorbonne Université in Paris 🇫🇷, in the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique (ISIR). My research focuses on Machine Learning surrogate methods for modeling Dynamical Systems.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BSc in Physics from the University of Valencia, Spain 🇪🇸, and a MSc in Complex Adaptive Systems from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden 🇸🇪.

🔎 Some of my research interests include:

- Physics-aware Neural Networks
- Dynamical Systems
- Chaotic systems
- Uncertainty Quantification
- Bifurcations and Critical transitions
- AI/ML/DL in a broader sense

Other scientific topics which I'm interested in but that are not part of my PhD work are:

- Astrophysics
- Quantum Computing
